> Usage:    load pedigree <filename> [-founders]   ; loads pedigree file
> 
> 
> If the pedigree file contains founders only, i.e. a set of
> unrelated individuals with no parental data, parent ID fields
> are not required.  In this case, the '-founders' option must
> be included in the load command.  If this option is specified
> but the pedigree file does contain parent ID fields, those
> fields will be ignored
